  # A class to represent the SDR repository store

  # ====Data Model
  # * <b>{StorageRepository} = represents a digital object repository storage node</b>
  #   * {StorageServices} = supports application layer access to the repository's objects, data, and metadata
  #   * {StorageObject} = represents a digital object's repository storage location and ingest/dissemination methods
  #     * {StorageObjectVersion} [1..*] = represents a version subdirectory within an object's home directory
  #       * {Bagger} [1] = utility for creating bagit packages for ingest or dissemination
